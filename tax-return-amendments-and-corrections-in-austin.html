With an experienced CPA firm nearby handling your books and taxes, you significantly reduce compliance risks and penalties.  Some red flags to watch out for include:Lack of credentials: A tax accountant should have relevant credentials, such as a CPA, EA, or ATA.  <br><br>  Choosing the right CPA is a crucial decision that can significantly impact your financial well-being, whether for personal finance management, business accounting, or specialized financial services.
